### What i learned

The website toke from me about a week ,each day like 4~5 hours
i have to say i learned a lot of things in this week : 
- How to think in React : (65% work time) managing Stats and Props between components which is pretty challenging ,hooks (useEffect specially)
- How to deal with APIs, json formatting and fetching the data with js and python
- some backend with Flask framework (Routing, using variables in the URL )
- Material Ui has some good react components the ones that i have worked with were (Data Grid,Tooltip,Accordion,Skeleton,Tabs,Drawer) ,they were so useful i struggled costuming the data grid components
- TailWind Css which is in my opinion the best css framework /
